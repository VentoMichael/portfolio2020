            - A little about Curriculum vitae
            - Branding
            - Curriculum vitae


### Text :
            - This project is my curriculum vitae, in a virtual way based on a well-known site, IKEA the famous                furniture seller.
            - In my second year, I had to make a web site representing my curriculum vitae based on an extremely              popular site (Amazon, Ebay, ...), for my part I took IKEA, a company selling furniture.
            - I had a very clear idea of how I wanted the logo to look like the IKEA logo. I used the same color              palette as the famous IKEA website.
            - The aim of this website is to accura- tely reflect the style of the famous website (IKEA), the color            palette used is the same as that of IKEA.
            - If you like this project, please take a second to share with the world !
